Changes and small incremental bug fixes applied since last release.
- bugfix due to Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen noticing that cov_deriv_sq_dist.m was missing in the distribution
- bugfix due to Joris Mooij in gp.m where the wrong mode for post.L was chosen when using infFITC and post.L being a diagonal matrix
- updated use of logphi in lik/likErf
