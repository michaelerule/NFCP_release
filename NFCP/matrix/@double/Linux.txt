1. Introduction

	This package contains binaries of a Linux port of Marcel Leutenegger's
	performance enhanced elementary MATLAB functions. Since these functions
	are implemented in architecture specific assembly language, they only
	work on x86-based Linux systems. Thanks to MATLAB's mostly platform
	independent way of dealing with MEX functions, these primitives can
	and should be installed and used in the way that is described in the
	"Readme.txt" file.


2. Requirements

	• An x86-based Linux system with an Intel Pentium II class (or better)
	  processor.
	• MATLAB R13 build 6.5.0.180913a or newer.


3. Compatibility

	These functions have been compiled using GCC version 3.3.4 on a GLIBC
	2.3 based system. I sucessfully tested their functionality on a recent
	Debian (testing) and a recent Gentoo (2004.1) system. However, I know
	that certain binaries that were compiled on GLIBC 2.3 based systems do
	not run on systems with older versions of this library. Since I don't
	have access to any such Linux system, I cannot verify whether this is
	the case for the MEX functions provided here.


4. Trademarks

	MATLAB is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc. Linux is a
	registered trademark of Linus Torvalds. Pentium II is a registered
	trademark of Intel Corporation. Other product or brand names are
	trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders.
