Neural Field Cox Process (NFCP) documentation
==================================================

This project demonstrates state inference and likelihood computation
for spatiotemporal neural field models with point-process 
observations.

The various functions in this package are documented on the `NFCP
<./NFCP.html>`_ page.

This is a Matlab package (despite the python-style website)

Simple examples ... coming soon!
